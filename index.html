    Here is what it will be. Talking about myself seems imposible without telling how did I chose some of the things important to me. Ok, maybe not just things, but you can see that later.
</p>
<p>
    I am going to share some of the stories I like, reminding me to always keep my mind sharp for the life lessons. Honestly they can be found everywhere. Literally.

<table>

    <tr>
        <div>
         When I say everywhere, usually, that points at two directions:

<th>Things that can be learned at workplace
</th>
    <th>Things that you can find at home and around</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>


<td>that will be covered in section1</td>
<td>that will be covered in section2</td>
</tr>


</div>
</table>
<p>
how do you approach these sections?</p>
<p>Well, you can use these cards below, or simply follow the navigation bar</p>
