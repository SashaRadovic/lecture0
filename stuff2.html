<h2 id="top">On lions and good ideas</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a huge gathering of animals. Lion, as the king has a game changing proposal that will lead the animal world towards advancement. The order was to build a toilet on a glade so every animal could use it. </p>
<p>-It's time to be more civilized, Lion concluded, and so it was.
</p>
<p>A few days passed and it seemed animals accepted the novelty. But, one day, Lion noticed that the toilet window was broken. Lion was furious and immediately summoned all the animals:</p>
<p>-Who did it? Who was that savage holding back our progress?</p>
<p>Slowly with a head bowed in shame Rabbit raised his hand.</p>
<p>-It was me.</p>
<p>-How ? Why?</p>
<p>-Well, Bear was in the toilet and he ran out of toilet paper, and I was close... and.. after he finished he threw me trough the window. So it was me who broke it.</p>
<p>Lion knew that he needs to react in order to stop the further toilet devastation. His lecture to small Rabbit in front of all the animals lasted for hours.</p>
<p>But, alas, incidents continued. Every now and then the window was broken, and the list of those who were to blame got longer. The shame list contained names of the Squirrel, Rat, Weasel, even the Fox was captured once in the crime.</p>
<p>After a while no one really listened Lion's long lectures about prosperity and civilization. Animals have been fixing the window after every incident.</p>
<p>Until one day.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Toilet was completely destroyed and only stones and some wood left as a reminder of great idea.</p>
<p>Lion was devastated. His idea of prosperity vanished. He roared in rage:</p>
<p>-Summon all the animals! Now I will punish this criminal! Who did it?</p>
<p>Slowly with a head bowed in shame Hedgehog raised his arm....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-I did it Mr. Lion sir, Bear was in the toilet, and he ran out of toilet paper, and... I was the only one nearby...</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how come this story is connected to corporations?</p>
<p>Well, imagine that one day some ( or your) CEO decided to implement an innovation. Constant run with the competition requires a lot of changes. Ideas come and go. Some of them are teasing enough to put us into action and if the CEO( boss , owner, teacher...) doesn't want to end up with a broken toilet, some simple rules should be followed.</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Provide an explanation</b> why the company needs change. Than means, anticipate possible negativism. People (and animals) have a fear of the unknown. Some lightening doesn't hurt.</li>
    <li><b>Provide support.</b> Marketing , back office, processes, tools. Whatever needs to be provided. Lack of toilet paper started the troubles in the woods after all. Lack of support will produce similar things in any project.</li>
    <li><b>No protected species.</b> Bears like to twist the rules as they like only if you let them. Most managers have their pets, and they like it too. However, if there are clear rules and assignments, everyone should comply. Otherwise, constant rule breaking behavior will eventually find the way to raze the project. Or toilet.</li>
    <li><b>People tend to play along.</b> If they are not challenged, that is. They will even accept the guilt rather than clashing with the boss. Accepting a solution just because it might be convenient at the moment is a regret material. If it feels bad it probably is bad. That means, some changes in processes, or products or services require organizational changes. New roles are assumed.</li>
    <li>No, that's pretty much of it. But I'm sure there are some more things to add as an example connected to the story. Sometimes we need to stand behind the shards of whatever left of our idea just to know what went wrong. And what not to repeat next time. it's a learning process. I hope at least Lion learned his lesson.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote>
    In a wider context, those small, always-taking-the guilt, animals are easy to spot in everyday life. Whenever we start a project or simply follow a New Year's resolution ( ah weight loss) they are always present. Those creatures or, as I like to call them " usual suspects", are followers of all our activities. In times of trouble, we tend to blame it on known issues. In my industry, banking, usual suspects, guilty for almost all failures are: RISK department, aggressive competition and of course global crisis. So every project that didn't go as planned will eventually sacrifice the fur of one of those three.

<p>
Not so simple job of a manager(or entrepreneur, or New Year's resolution apprentice) is to find the Bear, take him out on the open and show the real problem to face with. It might look easy but it's quite a challenge. Too many furry hands are blocking the way.</p>
