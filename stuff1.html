<h2 id="top">How did I find my life coach</h2>
<p>Not so long ago, the most difficult challenge appeared in my life. I became a parent. Beautiful child moved in my life creating such a joy i never thought i can experience. Being naive in my new  life role i was thinking of how many things I can, and have to teach the junior.</p>
<p>Fortunately, i figured this process is going both ways. In numerous cases the kid was the one who has  a role of a teacher (not to teach me how to throw a basketball, although he has a strong left  arm). Whoever was in this position knows what i am saying, but here is a little list of techniques the kid made me master very fast.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>I learned about patience</b> - try to put a baby to sleep without it and you will figure why this is needed</li>
    <li><b>I learned how to listen</b> -different variations of baby voice mean different things, classic try and attempt way of learning</li>
    <li><b>I learned how to read body signs</b> - no need to explain that, you will do anything just to avoid body signs become vocal.</li>
</ul>
<p>And above all, I learned that one look into baby`s eyes can actually stop time.</p>
<p>My baby grew up (i mean he is seven now), but the lessons learned were here to stay. In my job, I meet a lot of people, some brilliant and some, well, not very enlightened. Facing difficult situations was easier when you are able to see people being that little child, speaking the language understandable only to him, angry on the outside world unable to follow. Lessons about patience, listening and body language (and a lot more after that) helped me in my daily job. Lesson about time helped me to set priorities, establish a balance and not to over-burn.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe the world would be a much better place if we all had this type of understanding all the time. But we haven`t. I am a human, so I am no different in that matter. And this is how my son taught me that.</p>
<p>Back to his fourth year, all the parents from the neighborhood along with their children socialized in a small park, which connects several buildings. We spent all summer outside, after working hours, gathering together and watching our kids learn their first lessons in social interaction. Really nice way to spend peaceful summer afternoons. Occasionally, social interaction means arguing, pushing, screaming, but no big storms coming out of it. Parents were normal, so kids were too.</p>
<p>But there was one time that my kid came to me crying, and said that the other boy pushed him. I was a little annoyed, but told him to push the boy back or to play somewhere else. -But he is bigger than me and he is hitting me! - said the little one. Now I must make a small digression to explain what is "protective berserk mode", known to parents when their kids are attacked. It is, so to speak the state in which you can hear a bloodstream in your head. You do not think straight, and if it happens, it is highly recommended not to take any action until it passes.</p>
<p>Back to my point, in that state of mind, I told my four year old" - If he is bigger, then use a stick and the rock and defend yourself. Just to be clear, I was not proud of it then, and I am not proud of it today, but what happened after that was precious.</p>
<p>My kid took a small rock, size of a bean, and a few inches wooden branch, wondering: -Is that a stick and a rock, you meant dad?</p>
<p>I simply cannot describe the level of embarrassment I felt in that moment. I felt ashamed by his innocence, and I was proud of how pure his mind was. This combination of emotions literally brought tears to my eyes. I was standing in front of my son wanted to hug him, to thank him, to honor him for the lesson in humanity I will never forget.</p>
<p>What exactly happened? First, I severely exaggerated. It was not life or death situation, why did I react like that? The situation did not match the reaction.</p>
<p>Second, for me, in that situation, sticks and stones were weapons. For my kid there were toys to play with. In his mind, there was no connection between the toys and stopping the bully. Our mindsets were completely different.</p>
<p>Now let us back to the future.</p>
<p>As a manager, I am often in the position to resolve conflicts. There are numerous types of conflicts - between coworkers, between clients, between employees and clients, between different businesses. Every negotiation with a client is a kind of conflict (of interests). For all of them there are three fire points to be treated:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Severe exaggeration -often, both sides are fighting in their minds an epic battle (of principles). </li>
    <li>Different mindset - as a cause of initial misunderstanding -(sticks - branches)</li>
    <li>Need for a third party to resolve the conflict -the more lasting conflict is, deeper are the trenches, harder is to climb the surface.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
    In some cases, it seems there is no need for a third party but, as in my case with a kid, some enlightenment moment should end the stupidity. Then, I like to think, the third party is out of our reach. But it is always at the site, helping those little kids in us to get along again.
</blockquote>
<p>Conflict is unavoidable in the corporate world. I would lie, If I told you that I am in a third party role all the time. No, all three states apply to me. I overreact, I don't always have understanding, needed to level the mindset, and I am not always a valuable third party, but I do my best. Sometimes I see a clear pattern of possible actions, leading me to a solution. My reward is to see all opposed sides smiling at the end. In those moments i feel like sailing out of storm of different interests, fears, misunderstandings, all the things we gathered growing up. I remember the lesson my kid gave me. And i am endlessly grateful.</p>
